<h2 align="left">About me</h2>

###

<h6 align="left"> 
👋 Hey! I’m Emre — a Mechanical Engineering student who spends more time fixing simulations than running them.  
<br><br>
🧠 <i>Curious mind powered by caffeine, CAD, and curiosity.</i> ☕  
<br><br>
⚙️ I design things that (usually) work, and when they don’t — I learn why.  
<br><br>
📘 Currently exploring ways to make machines move without exploding.  
<br><br>
🚀 My mission?  
To turn random ideas into real mechanisms, one sketch at a time.  
<br><br>
🤝 Open to collaborations on anything that spins, moves, or makes weird noises.  
<br><br>
If it involves bolts, code, or caffeine — I’m probably already on it. 🔩

### ⚙️ What I Build With

> - 🧩 AutoCAD Inventor — for designing parts that (usually) fit  
> - ⚡ Arduino IDE — for making things blink and move  
> - 📊 Excel — because engineers can’t escape it  
> - 💡 MATLAB — where math meets chaos
