<h2 align="left">About me</h2>

###

<h6 align="left">👋 Hey! I’m Emre — a Mechanical Engineering student who spends more time fixing simulations than running them.<br><br>🛠️ Tools I occasionally master (and frequently break):<br>- AutoCAD Inventor — 95% designing, 5% force closing<br>- Arduino — blinking LEDs since childhood, still pretending it’s robotics 🤖<br>- Excel — using it like it’s MATLAB because why not<br><br>📚 Currently learning:<br>How to make machines move without exploding.<br><br>🚀 Goals:<br>Upgrade from “student” to “engineer (who actually knows what he’s doing)”.<br><br>🤝 Open to collaborating on anything that spins, moves, or makes weird noises.<br><br>If it has bolts or code — I’ll probably mess with it.</h6>

### ⚙️ What I Build With

> - 🧩 AutoCAD Inventor — for designing parts that (usually) fit  
> - ⚡ Arduino IDE — for making things blink and move  
> - 📊 Excel — because engineers can’t escape it  
> - 💡 MATLAB — where math meets chaos
